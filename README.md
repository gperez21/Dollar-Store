# Dollar Store Distribution
I wanted to look at the locations of dollar stores from three main corps (Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Dollar General) across the continental USA. I mapped these to congressional legislative districts and made maps of the rate of stores per district.

## Highlights

[Map of all districts:](https://github.com/gperez21/data_vis_wa/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/Dollar%20stores%20per%20district.pdf) Map of the whole continental USA with the nummber of dollar stores in each district.

[Stores per Congressional District (CSV):](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/Stata/Data/District_classification.csv) Only districts outside of the continental USA and those without any dollar stores are excluded.

[Mean Number of stores by Citylab cluster (CSV):](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/Stata/Data/Mean_store_by_cluster.csv) [Citylab](https://github.com/theatlantic/citylab-data/tree/master/citylab-congress) publishes "cluster" classifications for each congressional distric. This table shows the mean number of stores per district, broken down by Citylab cluster.
