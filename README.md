I wanted to look at the locations of dollar stores from three main corps (Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Dollar General) across the continental USA. I mapped these to congressional legislative districts and made maps of the rate of stores per district.


[Map of all districts:](https://github.com/gperez21/data_vis_wa/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/Dollar%20stores%20per%20district.pdf) Map of the whole continental USA with the nummber of dollar stores in each district.
