# Dollar Store Distribution
I wanted to look at the locations of dollar stores from three main corps (Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Dollar General) across the continental USA. I mapped these to congressional legislative districts and made maps of the rate of stores per district.

## Highlights

### Maps
[**All districts:**](https://github.com/gperez21/data_vis_wa/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/Dollar%20stores%20per%20district.pdf) Map of the whole continental USA with the nummber of dollar stores in each district.

[**Pennsylvania State House:**](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/PA_house.pdf) Number of dollar stores per Pennsylvania state house districts.

[**Ohio Legislative Districts:**](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/Ohio_legislative.pdf) Number of dollar stores per Ohio State Legislative districts.

[**2016 Results and Stores (box plot):**](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/box_general_2016.pdf) Shows how the distribution of the number of stores in districts won by Clinton vs. those won by Trump.

[**Obama-Trump vs. Obama-Clinton (box plot):**](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/Obama_Trump.pdf) Shows how the distribution of the number of stores in districts That switched D-R vs. those that remained D in 2016.

[**Romney-Clinton vs. Romney-Trump (box plot):**](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/GIS/Maps/Romney_Clinton.pdf) Shows how the distribution of the number of stores in districts That switched R-D those that remained R in 2016.

### CSV
[**Stores per Congressional District (CSV):**](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/Stata/Data/District_classification.csv) Only districts outside of the continental USA and those without any dollar stores are excluded.

[**Mean Number of stores by Citylab cluster (CSV):**](https://github.com/gperez21/Dollar-Store/blob/master/Dollar%20store/Stata/Data/Mean_store_by_cluster.csv) Citylab publishes "cluster" [classifications](https://github.com/theatlantic/citylab-data/tree/master/citylab-congress) for each congressional district. This table shows the mean number of stores per district, broken down by Citylab cluster.
